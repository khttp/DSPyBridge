## Introduction to AI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. AI systems can perform tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain, allowing it to learn from large amounts of data.

## Applications
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
